    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Adobong Sitaw with Pork made of long beans and pork belly is an easy weeknight dinner that packs great flavors! 
        This adobo-style vegetable dish is hearty, tasty, and pairs well with steamed rice.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Filipino adobo has many variations, which is not surprising as almost any meat, fish, seafood, and vegetables can 
        be cooked with excellent results in the vinegar and spices characteristic of this indigenous cooking process.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of my favorites of these adobo variants is adobong sitaw, which is a great way to enjoy an otherwise bland-tasting yard 
        long beans. Tender-crisp sitaw swimming in a tangy and savory adobo sauce over piping-hot steamed rice is a combination that's 
        hard to beat! Add grilled or fried fish on the side, and you have a tasty and filling meal everyone will be fighting over.
