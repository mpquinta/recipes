            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Loco Moco is a classic and very popular Hawaiian comfort food made from a bed of rice topped with a ground beef patty and a fried egg smothered with rich gravy sauce. After doing a bit of research I have learnt that Loco Moco has quite an amusing origin. It is said that Loco Moco was created at the Lincoln Grill restaurant in Hilo, Hawaii by a request from a hungry group of Japanese-Hawaiian teenagers who wanted something cheap but filling. The teenagers decided to name the dish “loco moco” after their friend who was nicknamed ‘Crazy’ using the Spanish word for the name to create a catchy rhyme. <br><br>
                Nowadays this dish is famous worldwide and is especially popular in Japan as a western style (yoshoku) meal especially amongst children. There are many variations of loco moco but this version is a Japanese take on the dish using Japanese rice and hambagu style patties. It’s perfect for a weeknight dinner or an easy lunch on-the-go!</p>
