    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Instant Pot adaptation of the classic 
        Korean stew made with kimchi is so flavorful and rich! The texture of the kimchi turns out nice and soft in a fraction of the time.

        Kimchi jjigae (김치찌개) is a classic Korean stew made with flavor-packed old kimchi! It absolutely is one of my favorite comfort foods 
        of all time. Lately, I’ve been making it in my Instant Pot, and I really like how it turns out. The stew is flavorful and rich, and 
        he texture of the kimchi turns out nice and soft in a fraction of the time. In this recipe, I’ve adapted my stovetop kimchi jjigae recipe 
        for my 6 quart Instant Pot.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1-1/2 pounds well fermented kimchi about 3 cups of cut kimchi packed</li>
        <li>8 ounces fatty pork or beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 to 3 teaspoons Korean red chili pepper flakes gochugaru - adjust to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup juice from kimchi if available</li>
        <li>2 cups of water* 1/2 cup more if not using kimchi juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>8 ounces tofu</li>
        <li>2 scallions</li>
        <li>black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 to 2 teaspoons of sugar - optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the meat and kimchi into bite sizes. Slice the tofu (about 1/2-inch thick), and roughly chop the scallions.</li>
        <li>Push the Saute button of the Instant Pot. When it becomes hot, add the pork and kimchi along with the sesame oil and red pepper flakes until the kimchi is slightly softened and pork is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the kimchi juice, water, soup soy sauce, and garlic. Lock the lid, change it to the Soup mode, and adjust the time to 10 minutes. Set the steam valve to “Sealing”.</li>
        <li>When the Instant Pot beeps, turn the steam valve to “Vent” to quick release the pressure. Open the lid, and add tofu and scallions. Push the Saute button again, and boil for an additional 5 minutes or longer until the kimchi reaches the desired tenderness.</li>
